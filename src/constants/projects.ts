Traditional methods, such as CCTV cameras, often fall short, as they require time-consuming manual observation and fail to provide detailed behavioral insights, particularly regarding separation anxiety and overall well-being. The mobile application \"Meowtion Capture\" has been developed to offer cat owners real-time, detailed reports on five specific behaviors: sitting, standing, lying down, vomiting, and eating. Additionally, it provides first-aid instructions when abnormal behaviors are detected, ensuring timely interventions.The application employs Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and You Only Look Once (YOLO) for real-time video processing and behavior analysis, significantly enhancing the accuracy of existing monitoring solutions. The YOLOv8 model was trained and tested, and the application's performance was assessed through a comprehensive survey conducted with 37 participants, including 30 pet owners, 3 veterinarians, and 4 CS/ITprofessionals. Adhering to ISO 25010 standards, the mobile application achieved an overall average score of 3.82 out of 4.00 across all categories assessed by the developers. This rating indicates that the participants strongly agree with the application's effectiveness. Future research should focus on optimizingperformance, reliability, and user experience in feline behavioral analysis. Additionally, it is recommended that investigations explore advanced algorithms, robust error handling, intuitive backup solutions, and the integration of AI-driven features, while also expanding compatibility across platforms and considering applications for other animals and health monitoring.",

        description: "Tuberculosis (TB) is an infectious lung disease brough about by bacterial infection and is a major cause of death worldwide. Early and accurate screening is essential so it can be treated. To address this problem, the researchers developed an application that detects the presence of TB in Chest X-rays (CXR) images through image pre-processing, data augmentation, image segmentation and deep learning based classification. Online datasets were utilized to train the segmentation and classification model; A total of 704 CXR images were employed to train the U-Net segmentation model and a total of 1148 images were used to train the EfficientNetB3 classifier model. Experiment results have shown that the proposed U-Net model has achieved a recall, F1-score, AUC, accuracy, and precision of 95.04%, 96.17%, 97.07%, 98.07%, and 97.33%respectively. For the EfficientNetB3 model, values of 83%, 83%, 91.68%, 83.33%, and 83% were obtained for recall, F1-score, AUC, accuracy, and precision respectively. The imposition of heatmap over the CXR images through Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) has shown insights into the classification model's prediction. The performance of the system was also tested against a radiologist to gauge the degree of agreement using Cohen's Kappa. Using 50 random images from the test dataset, Kappa values of 0.56 and 0.64 between the radiologist and the system at classification threshold levels of 0.4 and 0.6, respectively. The research findings show the screening system’s capability of detecting TB in CXR images as well as itsapplicability in the clinical setting.",

This widespread use has increased the risk of smishing—phishing via SMS—where malicious URLs in messages direct users to sites designed to steal sensitive information. Filipinos, known for exchanging the highest volume of text messages globally, are especially targeted by smishing attacks, despite initiatives such as the Sim Registration Act. SmishX, an Android application, was developed to solve this problem by employing a machine learning algorithms to detect and block smishing URLs. The model utilizes feature extraction, Natural Language Processing (NLP), entropybased features, and a stacking classifier (Random Forest and XGBoost), combined with SMOTE for handling data imbalance, to achieve high detection accuracy. A survey based in ISO standards of Effectiveness, Performance, Usability, Reliability, and Security, SmishX collected a weighted mean score of 4.6 out of 5 from CS/IT professionals, faculty, and CS students. Based on the Evaluation metrics, the machine learning model used in SmishX achieved 99.29% recall, 99.49% precision, 99.48%specificity, 99.39% F1-score, and an overall accuracy of 99.38%.",

The proposed security system integrates multiple advanced algorithms to ensure high accuracy and reliability. The Haar Cascade Classifier is used for face detection, Local Binary Pattern Histogram (LBPH) for facialrecognition, and Background Subtraction Method (BSM) for motion detection. These algorithms are implemented on the Orange Pi Zero 3 microprocessor, which serves as the core processing unit. The system includes a camera to capture real-time video feeds.Programming and algorithm integration are performed using the Orange Pi IDE. The system connects to the internet to send real-time alerts to the user’s registered email address upon detecting an intrusion. To enhance user interaction and control, a dedicated website was developed, allowing users to monitor, control, and access detailed information about the security system. The system's performance was thoroughly evaluated using various classification metrics, such as false positive rates, false negative rates, precision, and recall. The results demonstrated that the integration of Haar Cascade, LBPH, and BSM algorithms significantly improved the system's ability to accurately detect and identify intruders. Extensive testing showed a reduction in false alarms and an increase in detection accuracy. User feedback was collected to assess the website's usability and functionality, with responses indicating high satisfaction with the real-time control and monitoring capabilities provided by the system.",
